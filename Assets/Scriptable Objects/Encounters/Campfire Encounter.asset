  description: You notice a light as you enter the room. A campfire blazes but with
    no one around it. How long has it been burning? Who made it? Where are they?
    Your body aches as it wants to <i>rest</i> here; however, it might be safer to
    <i>leave</i> incase whoever made it returns.

  restText: The tension in your muscles evaporate as you sit next to the campfire.
    Its roaring flames are dwindling.
  burnOutText: The once roaring flames disappear into darkness. Nothing remains other
    than the charred pieces of firewood. Your torch is your only source of light.
  ambushText: You look out into the darkness and see something staring back. Is it
    the one who built the campfire? Before you get your answers, it lunges at you.
  leaveText: You leave the campfire alone. Who knows who made it and when they are
    coming back.
