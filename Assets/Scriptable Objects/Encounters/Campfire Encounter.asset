  description: You notice a light as you enter the room. A campfire blazes with no
    one around it. How long has it been burning? Who made it? Where are they? Your
    body aches as it wants to <i>rest</i> here; however, it might be safer to <i>leave</i>
    incase whoever made it returns.

  restText: The tension in your muscles evaporate as you sit next to the campfire.
    Its roaring flames are dwindling.
  burnOutText: The once roaring flames disappear into darkness. Nothing remains other
    than the charred pieces of firewood. Your torch is your only source of light.
  ambushText: You stare into the darkness... and it stares back. Is it the one who
    built the campfire? Before you get your answers, it lunges at you.
  leaveText: You leave the campfire alone. Who knows who made it and when they are
    coming back.
