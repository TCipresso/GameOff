  failureResponse: You fail to open the trap. The spikes rise from the ground and
    pierce your foot. Luckily, they did not do that much damage, but you are going
    to have a limp for a while.
  successResponse: You free your leg from the trap. In the nick of time, you dive
    out of the way. The spikes narrowly avoiding you. Luckly the metal bars didn't
    shut too tight. You are relatively unscathed.
