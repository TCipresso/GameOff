  description: The walls are lined with jars of unknown substances. Books of arcane
    writings line the floor. A man with an overgrown beard and a sharp pointed hat
    stands in the middle of the room staring into a glossy white orb. Without turning
    to face you, the man says, "this orb sees the secrets of your future. Only those
    skilled in the arcane arts can look into it. If you know them, you may want to
    <i>chant</i> with me. Otherwise, it would be smarter to <i>pass</i> by."

  chantText: Though still not facing you, you can see the man's ears perk up. "You
    are a brave one to be sure," the man says, "but are you a smart one?"
  ignoreText: You walk past the man. Before leaving the room, you turn around. Nothing.
    As if he was never there. You shrug off this unconventional encounter and leave
    the room.
  smokeText: You reach into your bag and pull out your greatest tobacco. The man
    turns around and smiles. After a few hours, the man tells you, "I have not had
    something like this for a long time."
  chantPassText: The man tells you, "I believe you are worthy to search the orb."
    You approach the orb. "Look deep into it, and it will tell you what you need
    to hear," the man whispers to you. You turn around to look at him, but he is
    no where to be seen. With nothing else to do, you stare deep into the orb.
  chantFailText: The man lets out a hearty laugh, "only fools take on challenges
    they are unmatched for!" You start to feel dizzy. Did you say something wrong?
    Did you accidentally curse yourself? For a moment, your vision blurs. When your
    vision returns, the man is gone. The orb has losts its luster. It's nothing more
    than a decoration now. With nothing else to do, you leave the room.
