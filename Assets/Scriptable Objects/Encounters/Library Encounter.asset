  description: As you enter the room, the smell of old, decrepit books fill your
    nose. Ancient books line the walls and stack on top of each other as far as the
    eye can see. Who knows what ancience secrets this library stores. In the middle
    of the library sits a book upon a pedestal. It is written in a language you have
    never seen before. <i>Read</i> it or <i>ignore</i> it?

  readText: You peer into the words written on the page. The runes are plastered
    with no rhyme or rhythm; however, you start to piece together what is written
    the longer you stare.
  readSuccess: The words on the page start making sense to you, but what is written
    is far from clear. All that you can decipher is a mishmash of ramblings about
    secrets of a world far beyond your own. You do not know what you can do with
    this information. However, <color=#ff0000>you</color> have an idea.
  readFailure: The symbols on the page start to lose their form and meaning the longer
    you stare. You cannot understand a thing. Your head hurts and you feel sluggish.
  ignoreText: You hear pages turn as you walk past the pedestal; however, the book
    is gone when you turn around. The pedestal is topped with dust as if the book
    was never there. "Strange," you think before moving on.
