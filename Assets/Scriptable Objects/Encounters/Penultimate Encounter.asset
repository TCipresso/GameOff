  descriptions:
  - Your heart sinks as you approach a wall. The path forward has been cut off. Looking
    back, all you see is the darkness of the void. You can hear the scuttering of
    the creatures you came across and the ones you have not seen. All paths lead
    to this point. No way this is the end of the dungeon.
  - You press your head against the wall. There is <color=#ff0000>no</color> way
    through it.
  - In your frustration, you punch the wall. Your finger bleeds as you <color=#ff0000>clip</color>
    it against the wall.
  - <i>N</i>othing y<i>o</i>u try is getting you <i>c</i>loser to the end. It is
    as if <i>l</i>ife doesn't want you to continue. Even <i>i</i>f there was a route
    around, who knows what horrors occu<i>p</i>y this dungeon.
  - Give it up already. It should be clear that there is nothing you can do. You
    are stuck here and are completely at the whim of the dungeon's design. The only
    power <color=#ff0000>you</color> have is to give up.
