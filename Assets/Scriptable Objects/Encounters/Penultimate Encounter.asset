  noclipResponse: After uttering that word, you place your hand on the wall... and
    miss. Your hand went through the wall. You push the rest of your body through
    the wall. A corridor awaits on the other side.
  descriptions:
  - Your heart sinks as you approach a wall. The path forward has been cut off. Looking
    back, all you see is the darkness of the void. You can hear the scuttering of
    the creatures you came across and the ones you have not seen. All paths lead
    to this point. No way this is the end of the dungeon.
  - Upon closer inspection, you see a constant stream of dust pouring from the wall.
    Occasionally more dust falls out of the wall as if it was breathing.
  - You put your face against the wall. It's warm. The warm air of the wall classes
    with the permafrost air of the dungeon. There is something wrong with this wall.
  - You slam your tools against the wall. Nothing. You try again; harder this time.
    Nothing. You try with all your might. Nothing. It is as if this world only responds
    to the things it wants you to do. What it wants from you is unknown to you, but
    not <color=#ff0000>you.</color>
  - <i>N</i>othing y<i>o</i>u try is getting you <i>c</i>loser to the end. It is
    as if <i>l</i>ife doesn't want you to continue. Even <i>i</i>f there was a route
    around, who knows what horrors occu<i>p</i>y this dungeon.
