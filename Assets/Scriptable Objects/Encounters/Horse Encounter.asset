  petResponse:
  - Its fur shines like the dawn of a new day. You can feel the horse's strong muscles
    under its skin. This horse has been well kept.
  - The soot of the nearby flame has tarnished the horse's fur. It has been in this
    room for a while.
  - As your hand passes through the horse's fur, you disturb the fine layer of dust
    that rests on the horse's skin. You can feel the horse's weakend muscles. It
    has been in this room for longer than it should have.
  - 'The horse lets out a weak neigh. Its fur unkempt. Its muscles atrophied. This
    is its first contact with someone for far too long. '
  - The horse stares furlong as if it doesn't notice you petting it. It doesn't react
    no matter how you pet it.
  - There are patches of fur missing. The exposed skin is sickly white. The horse
    looks at you as if it doesn't want to be alone anymore.
  - As you move your hand through the horse's fur, you can feel something move underneath
    its skin. It can't be the horse's muscles as they're far too athropied to feel.
  - As you run your fingers through the horse's mane, the horse jerks its head as
    it lets out a sickly cough. Parts of its mane are tangled to your fingers.
  - The horse pulls away from your hand. It stares at you. After some time, it approaches
    your hand. It jerks away once again when you touch it.
  - The horse's fur peels off its skin and gets stuck on the palm of you hand. You
    can see the horse's decayed muscles through the gaps in its skin.
  appleResponse: The horse chomps down on the apple as if it hasn't eaten in days.
    It is greatful. You don't feel any hostility from it.
  evilHorseAccept: The horse lunges at your hand. You pull your hand away before
    its mouth closes with all its might.
  evilHorseDeny: As you walk away, the horse stares with sadness in its eyes. A malice
    pierces the horse's dispair.
  goodHorseAccept: The horse guides you to its old owner's pouch. It is offering
    the belongings of its previous owner.
  goodHorseDeny: As you walk away, the horse stares with sadness in its eyes. Its
    dispair grows into grief.
