  batheString: As the water runs across your skin, you can feel it repair your broken
    body. Your dirty hair shining with a renewed beauty. Your skin smoothening with
    every drop. Your tired muscles regaining strength. However, before long, the
    water runs dry. The fountain used everything to bring you back to full strength.
    You thank it before moving on.
  ignoreString: The sounds of running water fill your ears as you walk away. You
    feel like you missed an enormous opportunity.
