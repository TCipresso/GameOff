  description: You walk down to the final room of the dungeon. Thinking of the gold
    and glory that awaits you at the end of the dungeon, you charge down the hallway...
    to find a goblin. Yes, it is bigger than most... but really? This is all there
    was at the end of the dungeon? Everything you worked for just for this??? You
    let out your anger on the beast.

    > This goblin is like no other. It has a glow to its eyes and is unusually
    large. The beast must have been enchanted by someone. It looks like it is carrying
    a golden key; possibly the key to <b><i>unlock</i></b> a near by chest. Please,
    please, please be a chest nearby. This cannot possibly be the last thing in the
    dungeon. If it is, unleash <b><i>all</i></b> of your anger onto it.'
